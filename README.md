## Hey guys, these are just some cool tampermonkey scripts I've made, below are descriptions for the scripts:

${{\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{ Discord shop remover}}}}\$: Removes shop from discord because nobody likes that shit

${{\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{ Twitch following homepage}}}}\$: Changes twitch.tv's homepage to its following page so you don't get blasted with audio from some random ass streamer you've never heard of

${{\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{ FIX DISCORD PINGS}}}}\$: A recreation of the classic extension that changes the repulsive yellow that makes me want to kms into a much nicer greyish blue
