## Hey guys, these are just some cool tampermonkey scripts I've made, below are descriptions for the scripts:

${{\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{Discord shop remover}}}}\$: Removes shop from discord because nobody likes that shit and if you actually use the dumbass shop then you're broke, stupid and gay.

${{\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{Twitch following homepage}}}}\$: Changes twitch.tv's homepage to its following page so you don't get blasted with audio from some random ass streamer you've never heard of.

${{\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{FIX DISCORD PINGS}}}}\$: A recreation of the classic extension that changes the repulsive yellow that makes me want to kms into a much nicer greyish blue.

${{\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{Remove Recommended Channels}}}}\$: Removes recommended and "viewers also watch" channels from twitch because idgaf about some random ass streamer and would much rather watch the ones I know and like.

${{\color{lightskyblue}{\textsf{Remove Habitica Party from Topbar}}}}\$: Removes Icons of habitica party members from the topbar where YOUR character is presented. I use habitica for ME and I don't give the slightest fuck about some randoms in my party, I don't need to see their ugly ass avatars on my front page every day.
