## Hey guys, these are just some cool tampermonkey scripts I've made, below are descriptions for the scripts:

$${\color{lightskyblue}Discord shop remover}$$: Removes shop from discord because nobody likes that shit

<code style="color : lightskyblue">Twitch following homepage</code>: Changes twitch.tv's homepage to its following page so you don't get blasted with audio from some random ass streamer you've never heard of

<code style="color : lightskyblue">FIX DISCORD PINGS</code>: A recreation of the classic extension that changes the repulsive yellow that makes me want to kms into a much nicer greyish blue
